The best way to maximise your score in aptitude tests is to practice and become familiar with the tests. We've helped thousands of applicants improve their score and help them land that dream job. Continue to navigate our site for more specialist tips on the different types of aptitude tests along with tons of practice material. But for now, let's get started with the tips...<br>
<br>
<b>Tip 1:</b>Practice<br>
Practice is the most commonly advocated route to aptitude test success, and one very few people would dispute. Familiarity with the style and format of aptitude tests will help calm your nerves and will allow you to focus all of your attention on answering the questions. The last thing you want during your real test is to waste time getting to grips with it. Practising questions and seeing where you went wrong will hopefully prevent you from making the same mistakes in your real test.<br>
<br>
<b>Tip 2:</b>Know your test<br>
Its's important to understand the type of aptitude test you're sitting. Each test is very different and will test different skills and will take different formats. Practising the tests you are required to sit will familiarise yourself with the format and help develop the skills they target. Some of the most common aptitude tests are listed below:<br>
*Numerical Reasoning<br>
*Verbal Reasoning<br>
*Inductive Reasoning<br>
*Logical Reasoning<br>
*Critical Thinking<br>
<br>
<b>Tip 3:</b>Don't get your friends to help<br>
If your test is online, it might be tempting to get a friend to help out. Apart from being immoral, this carries a large risk of backfiring.<br>
<br>
<b>Tip 4:</b>Make the most of online tests<br>
If you have been asked to take an online test, as opposed to one conducted at an assessment  centre, make the best use of this advantage. You have more factors in your control and you shouldn't neglect any of them.<br>
<br>
<b>Tip 5:</b>Be alert and stay focused<br>
Concentration and stamina are as important in timed psychometric aptitude tests as natural intelligence. If your concentration wanes during your test, you will waste valuable time. Ensure you slept well and are ready to focus and your mind simulated for a suststained period of time.<br>
